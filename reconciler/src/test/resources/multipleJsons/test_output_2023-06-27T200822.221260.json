      "description": "Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework for HTTP request handling. Stapler’s basic premise is that it uses reflective access to code elements matching its naming conventions. For example, any public method whose name starts with get, and that has a String, int, long, or no argument can be invoked this way on objects that are reachable through these means. As these naming conventions closely match common code patterns in Java, accessing crafted URLs could invoke methods never intended to be invoked this way.As of publication of this advisory, we are aware of the following potential attacks in the latest Jenkins releases that do not yet contain this fix:The previous two Jenkins security updates, LTS 2.121.3 and 2.138, as well as Jenkins LTS 2.138.2 and 2.146 included changes that prevent a number of other attacks resulting from this vulnerability. The following is a selection of attacks that were discovered during fix development, and are already being prevented on current releases of Jenkins:Given the vast potential attack surface, we fully expect other attacks, that we are not currently aware of, to be possible on Jenkins releases that do not have this fix applied. This is reflected in the high score we assigned to this issue, rather than limiting the score to the impact through known issues.The Stapler web framework has been extended with a Service Provider Interface (SPI) that allows methods and fields to be excluded from routing. The implementation of that SPI in Jenkins now restricts which getter methods, do* action methods, and fields can be invoked reflectively by Stapler. Further details are available in the developer documentation:",

Notably, the configuration may have been changed to not allow a build to run on a given agent, but the workspace used during the previous execution still exists, and could allow browsing the file system outside the workspace.Neither browsing through the UI nor downloading directory content as a ZIP file allow accessing directories and files outside the workspace anymore.In rare cases, it may be desirable to disable this fix. To do so, set the Java system property hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.allowSymlinkEscape to true. Learn more about system properties in Jenkins.",

      "description": "The fix for SECURITY-499 introduced a mechanism that renamed user directories on disk as a user with an unsafe user name (user ID) is loaded. Insufficient input validation allowed attackers to rename such user directories even for users with a safe user name by submitting a crafted user name when attempting to log in, even with an invalid password. Doing so prevented users from logging in successfully afterwards.Jenkins no longer uses directory names as a reference for user names, making the on-load migration of user records unnecessary. Instead, the new file users/users.xml is used to map user names to the directories containing the user metadata.On the first startup after updating Jenkins to a version containing this fix, existing legacy user directories are migrated. For further advice related to this user record migration, see the LTS upgrade guide.",

This allows attackers able to submit pull requests (or equivalent), but not able to commit directly to the configured SCM, to effectively change the Pipeline behavior by changing the library behavior in their pull request, even if the Pipeline is configured to not trust them.Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 566.vd0a_a_3334a_555 and 2.21.3 aborts library retrieval if the library would be retrieved from the same repository and revision as the current build, and the revision being built is untrusted.",

      "description": "Script Security Plugin provides a sandbox feature that allows low privileged users to define scripts, including Pipelines, that are generally safe to execute. Calls to code defined inside a sandboxed script are intercepted, and various allowlists are checked to determine whether the call is to be allowed.In Script Security Plugin 1.74 and earlier, any calls from outside a sandboxed script to code defined inside a sandboxed script were always allowed. As sandboxed scripts can communicate their results through script return values and similar mechanisms, this could result in code defined inside of a sandboxed script to be called without sandbox protection.This vulnerability allows attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.Script Security Plugin 1.75 will prevent code defined inside a sandbox from being invoked outside a sandboxed script.In rare cases, invocations of sandboxed scripts may begin failing if the script return value or script binding include code defined in the sandbox and is further processed by the calling code. To resolve this issue, the affected values need to be converted inside the sandboxed script to a known safe type, such as String.For compatibility with this change, the following plugins should be upgraded to the versions specified:",

This did not work in many instances, as plugins could use the Secret type to store credentials encrypted on disk while not having the Secret type appear in their Java API.Configuration as Code Plugin now inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of log message masking.As a workaround, administrators can configure the logging level of the logger io.jenkins.plugins.casc.Attribute to a level that does not include INFO messages.

      "description": "Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views. These views are frequently composed of several view fragments, enabling plugins to extend existing views with more content.In some cases attackers could directly access a view fragment containing sensitive information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding view.The Stapler web framework has been extended with a Service Provider Interface (SPI) that allows preventing views from being rendered. The implementation of that SPI in Jenkins now prevents view fragments from being rendered. Further details are available in the developer documentation.Most views in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins should be compatible with this change. We track known affected plugins and their status in the Jenkins wiki.In rare cases, it may be desirable to disable this fix. To do so, set the Java system property jenkins.security.stapler.StaplerDispatchValidator.disabled to true. Learn more about system properties in Jenkins.",

This was implemented in the fix for SECURITY-1279 in the 2019-07-31 security advisory.That fix was incomplete and did not cover a log message written to the logger io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator.Configuration as Code Plugin now uses the same secret detection for these log messages.As a workaround, administrators can configure the logging level of the logger io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator to a level that does not include these messages. Configuration as Code Plugin 1.25 and earlier logs these messages at the INFO level, Configuration as Code Plugin 1.26 logs them at FINE. See the logging documentation for details.",

      "description": "Unauthenticated users could provide maliciously crafted login credentials that cause Jenkins to move the config.xml file from the Jenkins home directory. This configuration file contains basic configuration of Jenkins, including the selected security realm and authorization strategy. If Jenkins is started without this file present, it will revert to the legacy defaults of granting administrator access to anonymous users.The fix prevents this behavior.To mitigate this problem, we strongly advise that administrators of Jenkins instances without this fix, that are reachable by untrusted users, save the global configuration shortly before shutting down Jenkins. Doing so will write the current configuration from memory to the config.xml file, which is only read on startup or when reloading configuration.If Jenkins has already been shut down after this issue has been exploited, the config.xml file can be found at users/$002e$002e/config.xml in the Jenkins home directory.This issue was caused by the fix for SECURITY-499 in the 2017-11-08 security advisory.",

      "description": "When pipelines are created using the pipeline creation wizard in Blue Ocean, the credentials used are stored in the per-user credentials store of the user creating the pipeline. To allow pipelines to use this credential to scan repositories and checkout from SCM, the Blue Ocean Credentials Provider allows pipelines to access a specific credential from the per-user credentials store in Pipeline SCM API for Blue Ocean Plugin 1.25.3 and earlier.As a result, attackers with Job/Configure permission can rewrite job configurations in a way that lets them access and capture any attacker-specified credential from any user’s private credentials store.Pipeline SCM API for Blue Ocean Plugin 1.25.4 deprecates the Blue Ocean Credentials Provider and disables it by default. As a result, all jobs initially set up using the Blue Ocean pipeline creation wizard and configured to use the credential specified at that time will no longer be able to access the credential, resulting in failures to scan repositories, checkout from SCM, etc. unless the repository is public and can be accessed without credentials.Administrators should reconfigure affected pipelines to use a credential from the Jenkins credential store or a folder credential store. See this help page on cloudbees.com to learn more.To re-enable the Blue Ocean Credentials Provider, set the Java system property io.jenkins.blueocean.rest.impl.pipeline.credential.BlueOceanCredentialsProvider.enabled to true. Doing so is discouraged, as that will restore the unsafe behavior.Administrators not immediately able to update Blue Ocean are advised to disable the Blue Ocean Credentials Provider through the UI at Manage Jenkins » Configure Credential Providers and to reconfigure affected pipelines to use a credential from the Jenkins credential store or a folder credential store.",
