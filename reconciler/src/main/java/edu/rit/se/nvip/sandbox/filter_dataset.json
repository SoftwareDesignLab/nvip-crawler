The vulnerability works by targeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a rogue domain name when the cached delegation information is about to expire. The rogue nameserver delays the response so that the cached delegation information is expired. Upon receiving the delayed answer containing the delegation information, Unbound overwrites the now expired entries. This action can be repeated when the delegation information is about to expire making the rogue delegation information ever-updating.

The vulnerability works by targeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a subdomain of a rogue domain name. The rogue nameserver returns delegation information for the subdomain that updates Unbound's delegation cache. This action can be repeated before expiry of the delegation information by querying Unbound for a second level subdomain which the rogue nameserver provides new delegation information. Since Unbound is a child-centric resolver, the ever-updating child delegation information can keep a rogue domain name resolvable long after revocation.

This codebase contains a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication and access control channel data on servers configured with deferred authentication. It is possible that this control channel data could be used to trigger further information leaks or gain access to protected networks. If the client-side scripting feature is in use, these scripts could be obtained through such an attack. If those scripts contain sensitive information, this information could be compromised. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have a valid, user-locked or auto-login client profile for the vulnerable Access Server, or credentials to obtain such a profile. Although exploiting this vulnerability requires some preparation on the attacker's side, the severity of a successful attack is high to critical, depending on the gained information. Additionally it was found that it was possible to do a Denial of Service attack using a similar method in the OpenVPN Access Server. We therefore strongly recommend upgrading your Access Server to the latest version to address the vulnerability.\nUpdate your OpenVPN Access Server to version 2.8.8 as soon as possible, which contains the fix for this vulnerability.

The userspace \"data->block[0]\" variable was not limited to a number between 0-255 and was used as the size of a memcpy, possibly writing beyond the end of dma_buffer. This issue could allow a local privileged user to crash the system or potentially achieve code execution. An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's SLIMpro I2C device driver. The flaw lies in the xgene_slimpro_i2c_xfer() function. Quoting the upstream commit below: \"The data->block[0] variable comes from user and is a number between 0-255. Without proper check, the variable may be very large to cause an out-of-bounds when performing memcpy in slimpro_i2c_blkwr.\"\n\nUpstream fix:\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/92fbb6d1296f This was fixed for Fedora with the 6.2.9 stable kernel updates.","cve_id":"CVE-2023-2194","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034023000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2188396","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":2825,"raw_description":"\nDescriptions LINE client for iOS before 11.15.0 might expose authentication information for a certain service to external entities under certain conditions. ...

This could be used by a site user to make the system Apache execute code as root user, since the System Apache is typically started initially with root privileges. To eliminate the privilege escalation, you will have to execute the command omd update-apache-config [SITE] once for each of your sites after the omd update command. Besides the one-time fix, this change has a consequence for the use of omd config and omd update. There are two situations where this is relevant: b) If you execute omd update and the proxy configuration changes To apply the latest apache configuration, the command omd update-apache-config [SITE] needs to be executed after the update. The omd update will automatically detect the need for this additional step and show you a confirmation dialog before starting the update to notify you about this necessary step and giving you the chance to interrupt the procedure in case you don't have the option to execute the command as root user. All maintained versions (>=1.6) are subject to this vulnerability. It is likely that also previous versions were vulnerable. Users of previous versions are highly recommended to update or consider other mitigations. # version: 0\n\n# Make sure that symlink /omd does not make problems\n<Directory />\nOptions +FollowSymlinks\n</Directory>\n\n<IfModule mod_proxy_http.c>\nProxyRequests Off\nProxyPreserveHost On\n\n<Proxy http://127.0.0.1:[PORT]/[SITE]>\nOrder allow,deny\nallow from all\n</Proxy>\n\n<Location /[SITE]>\n# Setting \"retry=0\" to prevent 60 second caching of problem states e.g. when\n# the site apache is down and someone tries to access the page.\n# \"disablereuse=On\" prevents the apache from keeping the connection which leads to\n# wrong devlivered pages sometimes\nProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:[PORT]/[SITE] retry=0 disablereuse=On timeout=120\nProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:[PORT]/[SITE]\n</Location>\n</IfModule>\n\n<IfModule !mod_proxy_http.c>\nAlias /[SITE] /omd/sites/[SITE]\n<Directory /omd/sites/[SITE]>\nDeny from all\nErrorDocument 403 \"<h1>Checkmk: Incomplete Apache Installation</h1>You need mod_proxy and\nmod_proxy_http in order to run the web interface of Checkmk.\"\n</Directory>\n</IfModule>\n\n<Location /[SITE]>\nErrorDocument 503 \"<meta http-equiv='refresh' content='60'><h1>Checkmk: Site Not Started</h1>You need to start this site in order to access the web interface.<!-- IE shows its own short useless error message otherwise: placeholder -->\"\n</Location> CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H 8.8 (https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) We assigned CVE-2022-46302 to this vulnerability.","cve_id":"CVE-2022-46302","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034008000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://checkmk.com/werk/14281","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":951,"raw_description":"\nand are related to the open source OpenVPN 2 project CVE report CVE-2020-15078\nPlease note that already installed software is not affected by this.

Some of these images may not be vulnerable for other reasons. We recommend that you also review the guidelines published on the upstream websites. CVE-2021-45449\nDocker Desktop versions 4.3.0 and 4.3.1 have a bug that may log sensitive information (access token or password) on the user’s machine during login. This only affects users if they are on Docker Desktop 4.3.0, 4.3.1 and the user has logged in while on 4.3.0, 4.3.1. Gaining access to this data would require having access to the user’s local files. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 4.3.2 or higher. Users should update to version 4.3.2 and may want to update their password. Users should not send local log files to anyone. Users can manually delete their log files, they can be located in the following folder: ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/log/host/ on Mac, and in C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Docker\\log\\host\\ on Windows. When a user installs 4.3.2 or higher, we will delete their local log files, so there is no risk of leakage after an update.\nAdditionally, these logs may be included when users upload diagnostics, meaning access tokens and passwords might have been shared with Docker. This only affects users if they are on Docker Desktop 4.3.0, 4.3.1, and the user has logged in while on 4.3.0, 4.3.1 and have gone through the process of submitting diagnostics to Docker. Only Docker support Engineers working on an active support case could have access to the diagnostic files, minimizing leakage risk from these files. We have deleted all potentially sensitive diagnostic files from our data storage and will continue to delete diagnostics reported from the affected versions on an ongoing basis.

The calculated score ranges between 0.0 and 10.0 whereas a high value declares a high risk. The main score is the base score which analyses the structure of the vulnerability only. The extended score called temp score introduces time-based aspects like exploit and countermeasure availability. Our moderators classify every entry to generate a CVSS score as accurate as posible.\n9.9\n9.8\n9.8\n9.4\n9.0\nTop vulnerabilities with the highest exploit price at the moment. These price estimations are calculated prices based on mathematical algorithm. This algorithm got developed by our specialists over the years by observing the exploit market structure and exchange behavior of involved actors. It allows the prediction of generic prices by considering multiple technical aspects of the affected vulnerability. The more technical details are available the higher the accuracy of the reproducable approximation.\nExploits are small tools or larger frameworks which help to exploit a vulnerability or even fully automate the exploitation. The development of exploits takes time and effort which is why an exploit market exists. By observing the market structure it is possible to determine current and to forecast future prices. This information might influence a risk assessment.\nNetbox unknown vulnerability\nTwister Antivirus IoControlCode filppd.sys 0x804f2140 unknown vulnerability\neScan Antivirus IoControlCode PROCOBSRVESX.SYS 0x22E008u unknown vulnerability\nTwister Antivirus IoControlCode filppd.sys 0x80800043 unknown vulnerability\nFlexiHub IoControlCode fusbhub.sys 0x220088 unknown vulnerability\nSome resarcher or news outlet provide videos discussing vulnerabilities, their possible exploitation or recommended countermeasures.

This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields.

A Denial-of-Service attack is possible through the GET parameter EStatementsIds located on the /Controls/Generic/EBMK/Handlers/EStatements/DownloadEStatement.ashx endpoint. The GET parameter accepts over 100 comma-separated e-statement IDs without throwing an error. When this many IDs are supplied, the server takes around 60 seconds to respond and successfully generate the expected ZIP archive (during this time period, no other pages load). A threat actor could issue a request to this endpoint with 100+ statement IDs every 30 seconds, potentially resulting in an overload of the server for all users. ------------------------------------------ [VulnerabilityType Other] Denial of Service ------------------------------------------ [Vendor of Product] ebankIT ------------------------------------------ [Affected Product Code Base] ebankIT - Omnichannel Digital Banking Platform - Version 6, patched in version 7 ------------------------------------------ [Affected Component] The endpoint existing at /Controls/Generic/EBMK/Handlers/EStatements/DownloadEStatement.ashx?EStatementsIds=*id*,*id*,*id*,etc ------------------------------------------ [Attack Type] Remote ------------------------------------------ [Impact Denial of Service] true ------------------------------------------ [Attack Vectors] I discovered it was possible to perform a Denial-of-Service attack on the ebankIT platform, potentially resulting in a single user rendering the entire application inaccessible.

The method is called traffic magnification and basically comes down to make a small request that results in a larger response to a specific target. Enough of these attacks could bring a server down (DoS). Other serious issues have also been found. You can read more about it in the pages linked to below. Fortunately for our users of the OpenVPN Access Server on AWS, our default security groups settings that come with the appliance do not provide access to the NTP daemon at all. So unless these were changed and access was granted to the NTP service port, this flaw cannot be exploited remotely with our Amazon AWS instances. CVE-2016-9310\nUbuntu has created their own page regarding this issue and they have issued fixes for the NTP package. Ordinary apt-get update and apt-get upgrade commands should update your packages to the latest versions that contain fixes for this particular issue. We recommend that everyone makes sure their system is regularly updated to ensure these security fixes arrive on your systems as well.\nNIST report CVE-2016-9310\nUbuntu USN-3349-1: NTP vulnerabilities\nSecurity audit vulnerabilities resolved\nMinor security vulnerabilities revealed by an audit of OpenVPN, an open source security software providing a safer and more secure internet to millions worldwide, have been fixed. The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, known as OSTIF, provided funding for the comprehensive security audit. OpenVPN 2.4.0 was audited for security vulnerabilities independently by QuarksLab and Cryptography Engineering between December 2016 and April 2017. The primary findings were two remote denial-of-service vulnerabilities.

A backend server could then decode slash sequences and normalize the path to provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy.","cve_id":"CVE-2021-31920","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034035000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":986,"raw_description":"\nImportant advisories of known security vulnerabilities in Sonatype products.\nCVE-2022-27907 Nexus Repository 3 - Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - 2022-03-30","cve_id":"CVE-2022-27907","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034483000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/sections/203012668-Security-Advisories","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":441,"raw_description":"\nCVE-2022-1199 Linux Kernel Vulnerability in NetApp Products","cve_id":"CVE-2022-1199","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034429000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":1378,"raw_description":"\nUpdate to a version of git that contains a fix for CVE-2016-2324 and CVE‑2016‑2315\nUpdate to a version of git that contains a fix for CVE-2016-2324 and CVE‑2016‑2315\nAfter upgrading Confluence, in product notification incorrectly indicates this version vulnerable to CVE\nXSS in Issue Type /editworkflowscheme.jspa - CVE 2021-26080\nUpgrade the bundled version of Apache Tomcat to 8.5.57\nUpgrade standalone Tomcat to 5.5.25\nUpgrade the bundled version of Apache Tomcat to 8.5.68 or later\nUpdate to a version of git that contains a fix for CVE-2016-2324 and CVE‑2016‑2315\nAfter upgrading Confluence, in product notification incorrectly indicates this version vulnerable to CVE\nXSS in Issue Type /editworkflowscheme.jspa - CVE 2021-26080\nUpgrade the bundled version of Apache Tomcat to 8.5.57\nUpgrade standalone Tomcat to 5.5.25\nUpgrade the bundled version of Apache Tomcat to 8.5.68 or later","cve_id":"CVE-2016-2324","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034343000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-75473?jql=text%20~%20%22CVE%22","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":1322,"raw_description":"\nIncomplete fix for CVE-2019-11250 allows for token leak in logs when logLevel >= 9 CVE-2020-8564 CVE-2020-8563 CVE-2020-8557 CVE-2020-8559 CVE-2020-8558","cve_id":"CVE-2019-11250","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034407000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/official-cve-feed/","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":1455,"raw_description":"\nCVE-2022-47144 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Plugincraft Mediamatic – Media Library Folders plugin <= 2.8.1 versions.

CVE-2015-8618\nInt.Exp Montgomery mishandled carry propagation and produced an incorrect output, which makes it easier for attackers to obtain private RSA keys via unspecified vectors. This issue can affect RSA computations in crypto/rsa, which is used by crypto/tls. TLS servers on 32-bit systems could plausibly leak their RSA private key due to this issue. Other protocol implementations that create many RSA signatures could also be impacted in the same way. Specifically, incorrect results in one part of the RSA Chinese Remainder computation can cause the result to be incorrect in such a way that it leaks one of the primes. While RSA blinding should prevent an attacker from crafting specific inputs that trigger the bug, on 32-bit systems the bug can be expected to occur at random around one in 2^26 times. Thus collecting around 64 million signatures (of known data) from an affected server should be enough to extract the private key used. Note that on 64-bit systems, the frequency of the bug is so low (less than one in 2^50) that it would be very difficult to exploit.","cve_id":"CVE-2015-8618","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034406000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/list","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":504,"raw_description":"\nCVE-2019-12401 Apache Solr Vulnerability in NetApp Products","cve_id":"CVE-2019-12401","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034429000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":2314,"raw_description":"\nCVE Link: Mitre Database: CVE-2021-44145 CVE-2021-44228\nMitre Database: CVE-2021-44145 CVE-2021-44228\nApache NiFi 0.1.0 - 1.15.0\nMitigation: The 'Secure processing' property will now apply to the configured XSLT file as well as flow files being transformed.

Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the distinction is documented at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). Using custom domains, it's possible to arrange things so that a Git repository is cloned to a folder named \".git\" by using a vanity import path that ends with \"/.git\". If the Git repository root contains a \"HEAD\" file, a \"config\" file, an \"objects\" directory, a \"refs\" directory, with some work to ensure the proper ordering of operations, \"go get -u\" can be tricked into considering the parent directory as a repository root, and running Git commands on it.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a valid low-privileged SSH key to an affected device from a host that has an IP address that is configured as the source for a high-privileged user account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected device through SSH as a high-privileged user. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco StarOS Software and are configured for key-based SSH authentication for multiple usernames that share the same IP address: For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software section of this advisory. To determine if a device is affected by this vulnerability, look for the authorized-key command in the server sshd configuration. A device is affected by this vulnerability if there are two or more instances of the command with the same IP address configured on the host parameter, as in the following example: [local]host_name(config-sshd)# authorized-key username Administrator1 host 192.168.1.1 [local]host_name(config-sshd)# authorized-key username Operator1 host 192.168.1.1 Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. To remove the attack vector for this vulnerability, user accounts configured for SSH key-based authentication must each use a different IP address. Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels. Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html In the following table, the left column lists Cisco software releases.

For details, see the Anthos clusters on VMware security bulletin. The Envoy project recently discovered a set of vulnerabilities. All issues listed below are fixed in Envoy release 1.21.1. CVE-2022-23606: When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was erroneously introduced in Envoy version 1.19 to the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. CVE-2022-23606 CVE-2022-21655 CVE-2021-43826 CVE-2021-43825 CVE-2022-21655: Envoy's internal redirect code assumes that a route entry exists. When an internal redirect is done to a route which has a direct response entry and no route entry, it results in dereferencing a null pointer and crashing. CVE-2021-43826: When Envoy is configured to use tcp_proxy which uses upstream tunneling (over HTTP), and downstream TLS termination, Envoy will crash if the downstream client disconnects during the TLS handshake while the upstream HTTP stream is still being established. The downstream disconnect can be either client or server initiated. The client can disconnect for any reason. The server may disconnect if, for example, it has no TLS ciphers or TLS protocol versions compatible with the client. It may be possible to trigger this crash in other downstream configurations as well. CVE-2021-43825: Sending a locally generated response must stop further processing of request or response data. Envoy tracks the amount of buffered request and response data and aborts the request if the amount of buffered data is over the limit by sending 413 or 500 responses. However when locally generated response is sent because of the internal buffer overflows while response is processed by the filter chain the operation may not be aborted correctly and result in accessing a freed memory block. CVE-2021-43824: Envoy crashes when using the JWT filter with a \"safe_regex\" match rule and a specially crafted request like \"CONNECT host:port HTTP/1.1\". When reaching the JWT filter, a \"safe_regex\" rule should evaluate the URL path but there is none here, and Envoy crashes with segfaults. CVE-2021-43824 CVE-2022-21654: Envoy would incorrectly allow TLS session resumption after mTLS validation settings had been reconfigured. If a client certificate was allowed with the old configuration but disallowed with the new configuration, the client could resume the previous TLS session even though the current configuration should disallow it. Changes to the following settings are affected: match_subject_alt_names CRL changes allow_expired_certificate Trust_chain_verification only_verify_leaf_cert_crl CVE-2022-21654 CVE-2022-21657: Envoy does not restrict the set of certificates it accepts from the peer, either as a TLS client or a TLS server, to only those certificates that contain the necessary extendedKeyUsage (id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth, respectively). This means that a peer may present an e-mail certificate (e.g. id-kp-emailProtection), either as a leaf certificate or as a CA in the chain, and it will be accepted for TLS. This is particularly bad when combined with CVE-2022-21656 , in that it allows a Web PKI CA that is intended only for use with S/MIME, and thus exempted from audit or supervision, to issue TLS certificates that will be accepted by Envoy. CVE-2022-21657 CVE-2022-21656: The validator implementation used to implement the default certificate validation routines has a \"type confusion\" bug when processing subjectAltNames. This processing allows, for example, an rfc822Name or uniformResourceIndicator to be authenticated as a domain name. This confusion allows for the bypassing of nameConstraints, as processed by the underlying OpenSSL/BoringSSL implementation, exposing the possibility of impersonation of arbitrary servers.

This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server. 9.4.51.v20230217 - via PR #9352 10.0.15 - via PR #9339 11.0.15 - via PR #9339 3.7 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N CVE ID CVE-2023-26049","cve_id":"CVE-2023-26049","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034237000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-p26g-97m4-6q7c","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":509,"raw_description":"\n8.1\nReolink RLC-410W cgiserver.cgi cgi_check_ability improper access control vulnerabilities\nCVE-2021-40413, CVE-2021-40414, CVE-2021-40415,CVE-2021-40416\n7.1\nReolink RLC-410W cgiserver.cgi JSON command parser denial of service vulnerabilities","cve_id":"CVE-2021-40413","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034467000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":480,"raw_description":"\nCVE Link: Mitre Database: CVE-2017-12623 CVE-2017-15703\nMitre Database: CVE-2017-12623 CVE-2017-15703\nApache NiFi 1.0.0 - 1.3.0\nDescription: Any authenticated user (valid client certificate but without ACL permissions) could upload a template which contained malicious code and caused a denial of service via Java deserialization attack.\nMitigation: The fix to properly handle Java deserialization was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.4.0 release.

A great number of services across the internet that use this library, including OpenVPN Access Server, may have been affected by this issue. Since learning of this issue, we have taken immediate necessary steps to ensure the security of OpenVPN and the OpenVPN Access Server product. Within 24 hours we have therefore released patches for specific versions of the Access Server that are affected, and we have released Access Server 2.0.6 with the fix for this issue already incorporated. If you are using an older version that contains the affected OpenSSL library you are advised to update immediately.\nThe affected versions of Access Server that contain the vulnerable OpenSSL library and are vulnerable to Heartbleed are:\nOpenVPN Access Server 1.8.4 and 1.8.5\nOpenVPN Access Server 2.0.0 / 2.0.1 / 2.0.2 / 2.0.3 / 2.0.4 and 2.0.5\nThe attack vector that is present on the Access Server with the vulnerable OpenSSL libraries is not present on the Connect Clients, so the risk on the client side is negligible. Only the server that your client connects to could possibly exploit this vulnerability, and even then it is unlikely because we use Perfect Forward Security and TLS-auth on top of the SSL connection which prevents this exploit from being successful. The security of the data channel itself is not particularly at risk, only the web services on the server themselves are. And even then, since we use a privilege separation model, the web services run in a completely different process than the OpenVPN daemons handling the data connections, and therefore the private keys for your OpenVPN connections are not likely to be at any risk. Even so, we did not take chances and have released a fix in OpenVPN Access Server 2.0.7 and newer versions, which incorporate updated clients as well. So update your clients as well.\nIf you have a version other than the aforementioned versions, you are not vulnerable to the Heartbleed vulnerability, but of course we always recommend to keep your system up-to-date. If you are running one of the mentioned versions, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version available from our website immediately.\nNote that mobile clients like on iPad, iPhone and Android devices, are not affected as they use PolarSSL instead, so no action needs to be taken there.\nThe OpenVPN Desktop Client is not receiving maintenance anymore, and has been deprecated for a while. All OpenVPN Access Server customers still using the OpenVPN Desktop Client for Windows should upgrade immediately to the OpenVPN Connect Client that comes bundled with our latest OpenVPN Access Server product. The OpenVPN Desktop Client is obsolete and is no longer maintained or available for download. This client contains a CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) vulnerability that can allow remote code execution by a malicious web site, as Stefan Viehböck, SEC Consult, has discovered. The OpenVPN Desktop Client also contains an older version of OpenSSL that has not received recent OpenSSL security updates. This advisory only applies to the OpenVPN Desktop Client app for Windows, and does not affect OpenVPN Connect Client, Private Tunnel, or OpenVPN open source builds for Windows.\nRelease Notes 2.11.3\nAccess Server 2.11.3 is the version now rolled out to the major cloud providers. For those using Access Server on a cloud provider, we recommend upgrading to the latest cloud image.","cve_id":"CVE-2014-0160","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034379000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://openvpn.net/security-advisories/","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":832,"raw_description":"\nofficial-cve-feed\nIssues or PRs related to CVEs officially announced by Security Response Committee (SRC)\nCVE-2021-25735: Validating Admission Webhook does not observe some previous fields\nofficial-cve-feed\nIssues or PRs related to CVEs officially announced by Security Response Committee (SRC)","cve_id":"CVE-2021-25735","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034218000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea%2Fsecurity+in%3Atitle+CVE&utf8=%E2%9C%93","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":1471,"raw_description":"\nCVE-2022-36033 jsoup Vulnerability in NetApp Products","cve_id":"CVE-2022-36033","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034429000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":2456,"raw_description":"\nPer VMware security advisory VMSA-2021-0010, remote code execution and authentication bypass vulnerabilities in vSphere Client (HTML5) were privately reported to VMware.

This issue results from improper locking when performing operations on an object. This flaw allows an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's RxRPC network protocol. Quoting ZDI security advisory [1]:\n\n\"This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of RxRPC bundles. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.\"\n\n[1] https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-439/ Upstream fix:\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3bcd6c7eaa53 Note that although this bug is present in the RHEL 9.0 and 9.1 source trees, the rxrpc module for those releases is not built, shipped or supported by Red Hat or AuriStor.\n\nFor RHEL 9.2, the rxrpc module will be enabled (partner supported and shipped), but the fix for the CVE has already been applied (see Red Hathttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2170099 and the associated merge request).\n\nSo there should not be any RHEL releases that are vulnerable to the issue in this CVE. Thanks Marc, I have updated the flaw bug's metadata accordingly. This bug is now closed.

The score is generated by separate values which are called vectors. Those vectors define the structure of the vulnerability. They rely on attack prerequisites and impact. The calculated score ranges between 0.0 and 10.0 whereas a high value declares a high risk. The main score is the base score which analyses the structure of the vulnerability only. The extended score called temp score introduces time-based aspects like exploit and countermeasure availability. Our moderators classify every entry to generate a CVSS score as accurate as posible.\n9.9\n9.8\n9.8\n9.4\n9.0\nTop vulnerabilities with the highest exploit price at the moment. These price estimations are calculated prices based on mathematical algorithm. This algorithm got developed by our specialists over the years by observing the exploit market structure and exchange behavior of involved actors. It allows the prediction of generic prices by considering multiple technical aspects of the affected vulnerability. The more technical details are available the higher the accuracy of the reproducable approximation.\nExploits are small tools or larger frameworks which help to exploit a vulnerability or even fully automate the exploitation. The development of exploits takes time and effort which is why an exploit market exists. By observing the market structure it is possible to determine current and to forecast future prices.

Note that unless specified otherwise, no binary or source patches are available. To obtain a security fix, you need to upgrade to the latest maintained version of Apache Groovy.\nReleases prior to 2.4.4 were not released under Apache so no official patches for security updates are available for older versions.\nCVE-2015-3253 Apache Groovy Information Disclosure\nUnsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 1.7.0 to 2.4.3\nFixed in version 2.4.4\nRemote execution of untrusted code, DoS\nWhen an application has Groovy on the classpath and uses standard Java serialization mechanisms to communicate between servers, or to store local data, it is possible for an attacker to bake a special serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability.\nMitigation:\nApache Groovy 2.4.4 is the first supported release under the Apache Software Foundation. It is strongly recommended that all users using serialization upgrade to this version. If you cannot upgrade or rely on an older, unsupported version of Groovy, you can apply the following patch on the MethodClosure class (src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/MethodClosure.java):\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\nCVE-2015-3253: Remote execution of untrusted code\nCVE-2020-17521 Apache Groovy Information Disclosure\nUnsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 2.0 to 2.4.4. Apache Groovy versions 2.4.4 to 2.4.20, 2.5.0 to 2.5.13, 3.0.0 to 3.0.6, and 4.0.0-alpha-1.\nFixed in versions 2.4.21, 2.5.14, 3.0.7, 4.0.0-alpha-2\nThis vulnerability potentially impacts Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows. On such OS versions, Groovy may create temporary directories within the OS temporary directory which is shared between all users on affected systems. Groovy will create such directories for internal use when producing Java Stubs (very low impact) or on behalf of user code via two extension methods[4,5] for creating temporary directories. If Groovy user code uses either of these extension methods, and stores executable code in the resulting temporary directory, then the risk is high, since this can lead to local privilege escalation. If such Groovy code is making use of the temporary directory to store sensitive information, then the risk is medium, since such information could be exposed or modified.\nWhen analyzing the impact of this vulnerability, here are the important questions to ask:\nIf you answer no to any of these questions, you are not affected. If you answered yes, does the Groovy code write or store executable code in the temporary directory? If you answer yes, the risk is high, and can lead to local privilege escalation. Does the Groovy code write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary directory? If you answer yes, the risk is medium, and information may be exposed or modified.\nGroovy was making use of a method in the JDK which is now flagged as not suitable for security-sensitive contexts. In addition, Groovy wasn’t checking a flag related to successful creation of the temporary directory which leads to a race condition whereby the vulnerability exists[1].\nFor the fixed versions, Groovy 2.5 and above is now using a newer JDK method which creates a directory that is only readable by the user running the Groovy code. The same is true for the fixed Groovy 2.4 version except if running on a pre-JDK7 version of the JDK in which case a fallback implementation is used which now checks for successful creation of the temporary directory. This eliminates the high-risk scenario involving the race condition whereby executables or information could be modified, but still leaves the potential for sensitive information leakage. Groovy 2.4/JDK 6 users are recommended to use the java.io.tmpdir mitigation.\nMitigation:\nSetting the java.io.tmpdir system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability for all operating systems and all Groovy versions.\nUsers who cannot easily move to the fixed Groovy versions may wish to consider using the JDK’s Files#createTempDirectory method instead of the Groovy extension methods.\nThis vulnerability was discovered by Jonathan Leitschuh (https://twitter.com/jlleitschuh)","cve_id":"CVE-2020-17521","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034007000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"http://groovy-lang.org/security.html","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":49,"raw_description":"\nRPA Platform 6.0-7.01 CVE-2022-36120\nRPA Platform 6.0-7.01 CVE-2022-36120","cve_id":"CVE-2022-36120","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034417000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://labs.cyberark.com/cyberark-labs-security-advisories/","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":760,"raw_description":"\nCVE-2021-21703 PHP Vulnerability in NetApp Products","cve_id":"CVE-2021-21703","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034429000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":2195,"raw_description":"\nMemory disclosure with specially crafted backend responses Severity: major Advisory CVE-2012-1180 Not vulnerable: 1.1.17+, 1.0.14+ Vulnerable: 0.1.0-1.1.16 The patch pgp CVE-2012-1180","cve_id":"CVE-2012-1180","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034006000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"http://nginx.org/en/security_advisories.html","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":2614,"raw_description":"\nCVE-2020-13954 Apache CXF Vulnerability in NetApp Products","cve_id":"CVE-2020-13954","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034429000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":2211,"raw_description":"\nCVE-2020-26116 Python Vulnerability in NetApp Products","cve_id":"CVE-2020-26116","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034429000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":1377,"raw_description":"\nCVE-2022-47139 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Damir Calusic WP Basic Elements plugin <= 5.2.15 versions.

The SecurityExtension introduced in commit 89d1ea1 attempts to address CVE-2023-22731 by overriding the map(), filter(), reduce() and sort() Twig filters (enabled by default) and ensuring that the callable is within the list of permitted PHP functions to be executed. However, there is a logic flaw whereby validation against the list of permitted functions is only performed if the argument passed to filter is a string. Passing an array as a callable argument allows the validation check to be skipped.\nConsequently, this allows a remote attacker with access to a Twig environment to call any arbitrary PHP function and thus execute arbitrary code/commands via usage of fully-qualified names, supplied as arrays of strings, when referencing callables.\nThe vulnerability can be found in the SecurityExtension class declared in src/Core/Framework/Adapter/Twig/SecurityExtension.php:\nNotice that the validation check is only invoked if $function is a string. As such, non-string arguments may be passed to [2] due to the absence of type enforcement at [1]. At [2], variable functions (i.e. $function($value)) is invoked, thereby allowing arbitrary PHP functions to be executed. Largely identical code pattern can also be observed for the reduce() filter (at [3] and [4]), filter() filter (at [5] and [6]) and sort() filter (at [7] and [8]).\nGoing back to [1], if $arrow is an array instead of a string or closure, the validation check to prevent invocation of unsafe functions is completely skipped.

For details, see the Anthos clusters on VMware security bulletin. The Envoy project recently discovered a set of vulnerabilities. All issues listed below are fixed in Envoy release 1.21.1. CVE-2022-23606: When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was erroneously introduced in Envoy version 1.19 to the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. CVE-2022-23606 CVE-2022-21655 CVE-2021-43826 CVE-2021-43825 CVE-2022-21655: Envoy's internal redirect code assumes that a route entry exists. When an internal redirect is done to a route which has a direct response entry and no route entry, it results in dereferencing a null pointer and crashing. CVE-2021-43826: When Envoy is configured to use tcp_proxy which uses upstream tunneling (over HTTP), and downstream TLS termination, Envoy will crash if the downstream client disconnects during the TLS handshake while the upstream HTTP stream is still being established. The downstream disconnect can be either client or server initiated. The client can disconnect for any reason. The server may disconnect if, for example, it has no TLS ciphers or TLS protocol versions compatible with the client. It may be possible to trigger this crash in other downstream configurations as well. CVE-2021-43825: Sending a locally generated response must stop further processing of request or response data. Envoy tracks the amount of buffered request and response data and aborts the request if the amount of buffered data is over the limit by sending 413 or 500 responses. However when locally generated response is sent because of the internal buffer overflows while response is processed by the filter chain the operation may not be aborted correctly and result in accessing a freed memory block. CVE-2021-43824: Envoy crashes when using the JWT filter with a \"safe_regex\" match rule and a specially crafted request like \"CONNECT host:port HTTP/1.1\". When reaching the JWT filter, a \"safe_regex\" rule should evaluate the URL path but there is none here, and Envoy crashes with segfaults. CVE-2021-43824 CVE-2022-21654: Envoy would incorrectly allow TLS session resumption after mTLS validation settings had been reconfigured. If a client certificate was allowed with the old configuration but disallowed with the new configuration, the client could resume the previous TLS session even though the current configuration should disallow it. Changes to the following settings are affected: match_subject_alt_names CRL changes allow_expired_certificate Trust_chain_verification only_verify_leaf_cert_crl CVE-2022-21654 CVE-2022-21657: Envoy does not restrict the set of certificates it accepts from the peer, either as a TLS client or a TLS server, to only those certificates that contain the necessary extendedKeyUsage (id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth, respectively). This means that a peer may present an e-mail certificate (e.g. id-kp-emailProtection), either as a leaf certificate or as a CA in the chain, and it will be accepted for TLS. This is particularly bad when combined with CVE-2022-21656 , in that it allows a Web PKI CA that is intended only for use with S/MIME, and thus exempted from audit or supervision, to issue TLS certificates that will be accepted by Envoy. CVE-2022-21657 CVE-2022-21656: The validator implementation used to implement the default certificate validation routines has a \"type confusion\" bug when processing subjectAltNames. This processing allows, for example, an rfc822Name or uniformResourceIndicator to be authenticated as a domain name. This confusion allows for the bypassing of nameConstraints, as processed by the underlying OpenSSL/BoringSSL implementation, exposing the possibility of impersonation of arbitrary servers.

The NRDelegation Attack works by having a malicious delegation with a considerable number of non responsive nameservers. The attack starts by querying a resolver for a record that relies on those unresponsive nameservers.\nThe attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot of time/resources resolving records under a malicious delegation point where a considerable number of unresponsive NS records reside. It can trigger high CPU usage in some resolver implementations that continually look in the cache for resolved NS records in that delegation.

The report mentioned the OpenVPN protocol. As part of good security principles, we are looking into this and any possible attack vectors, however we have found no flaws in the OpenVPN software.\nAn initial investigation by our security experts, and experts across the globe, reveals that this issue affects all network interfaces, not VPN in particular.\n“It doesn't appear to be a flaw in the OpenVPN software, but a flaw in the configuration of the operating system itself. The issue is more in how the operating system deals with this type of attack in general, rather than anything going wrong in the VPN connection itself,” says OpenVPN Access Server Product Manager, Johan Draaisma.\nTo our knowledge, the vulnerability is only impacting Linux and Unix systems and requires that the attacker has control over your Internet access point and can therefore reach and affect your computer outside of the VPN, in the local network, for example. Based on this, the attack is somewhat limited, and there is no straight-forward way to retrieve unencrypted data from the VPN connection.\n“The issue may actually be located in the Linux operating system settings rather than in our software, but given the serious nature of the attack, we are paying close attention and will consider whatever steps are appropriate to ensure OpenVPN remains safe to use on these affected platforms. For now enabling the ‘reverse path filter’ setting in the OS is a good first step to help protect against this attack,” says Draaisma.\nOpenVPN Inc. is keeping a close eye on the discussions currently ongoing, and possible solutions. Currently there is no evidence suggesting there is a flaw in the OpenVPN software itself.\nPlease note that this change does not affect our Amazon AWS tiered instances that are pre-licensed with a predefined amount of connections. These are billed through Amazon AWS directly and use a different licensing system that does not need this update.\nYou should upgrade your Access Server to the latest version available on our software packages page, which includes the changes to the licensing system. Alternatively, if you do not wish to upgrade now, you may use our licensing patch to update only the licensing code on an existing Access Server. The patch is designed so it can be applied live without shutting down or cold restarting the Access Server service, so VPN clients don't need to be disconnected, and it is compatible with Access Server 1.8.3 and above.\n\"Does this affect the licenses currently on my server?\"\nNo. Those are completely unaffected and will continue to function normally.\n\"I use a very old version of Access Server, older than 1.8.3.\"\nUnfortunately the new licensing system cannot function properly on an Access Server that old. Version 1.8.3 is from around 2011, so very old. Aside from the security considerations of running severely outdated software, we also just do not support such an old version anymore. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest version. However, if for whatever reason you must continue running such old software, and wish to activate a license key on this, contact our support ticket system and let us know the license key you wish to activate, and we will help you perform an activation procedure for your Access Server.\nIt is important to note here that OpenVPN Access Server was not affected by this issue. We are talking here about open source implementations of OpenVPN that were using certificates signed with a hashing method called MD5 that has been determined to be broken and which should not be used anymore. Customers of our commercial OpenVPN Access Server offering did not suffer from these problems and do not need to take action. This only really affects people using an open source OpenVPN implementation either set up themselves or part of a third-party embedded product like a router or VPN server product.\nWe have temporarily added support for MD5 type signature hashes back into the OpenVPN Connect for Android app, which is available on the play store now. If you upgrade to this version then this particular problem should be resolved for you. But the real problem, namely the use of MD5 hash certificates, is not resolved by this. It is strongly encouraged to use secure certificates instead of the flawed MD5 type certificates. It is absolutely not secure to use these older type of certificates and we cannot in good conscience continue to support such a poor level of security in our OpenVPN security product. Therefore support for MD5 will be ending in May of 2018. This gives our users time to migrate to a secure configuration using for example certificates signed with SHA256 type hash or better.\nThe VORACLE attack vulnerability\nSecurity researcher Ahamed Nafeez has presented a new attack vector which targets VPN tunnels which utilize compression, named VORACLE. The attack vector bears similarities to the CRIME and BREACH attacks, which hit especially HTTPS based connections.\nIt has been discovered that it is possible to gain information about an encrypted VPN tunnel's contents in very specific circumstances, if an attacker has the ability to capture the encrypted data packets while a certain type of data is transferred through the VPN tunnel. By that we mean that if a VPN user visits for example an unencrypted HTTP website through an encrypted VPN tunnel, and this information is being compressed and encrypted through the VPN tunnel, certain clues about the contents of this information can still be gathered if the encrypted packets can be captured and analysed, and data can be fed through the VPN tunnel by the attacker. To explain this better, following below is a simplified example. The example mentioned here is not the only possible attack against encryption combined with compression, and it is also very simplified, but it is useful to explain the principle behind attacks like VORACLE, CRIME and BEAST.\nLet's say Alice has setup a login page. To check passwords entered there, Alice sends a message like \"tell me if <the password entered> matches <secret password>\" to Bob. This information between Alice and Bob is sent through an encrypted VPN tunnel that also uses compression. The more similar the <the password entered> is to <secret password> the better this message compresses. If the attacker Eve can ask Alice to verify passwords and can see the length of the encrypted VPN messages, she gets a pretty good idea how close her guesses are, since the encrypted messages get shorter when her guesses get better.\nWithout compression the length of the encrypted packets does not change, so Eve cannot gain any information from this. Strictly speaking the length changes if Eve's password length changes but that gives no additional information. The real world attacks are more complicated and need to take in account the specific circumstances (for example HTTPS or VPN) but they rely on the same principle as demonstrated in this simple example.\nMitigation\nDue to the fact that exploiting such an attack is not trivial, we are not treating this situation as an emergency. For now, it is advised that users of the OpenVPN Access Server and the OpenVPN Connect Client software disable the use of compression. This effectively makes exploiting this vulnerability impossible. This can very easily be done on the OpenVPN Access Server by going to the admin web interface, and going to Advanced VPN. There you can disable compression. The client connection profiles may still provide an instruction to enable compression, but it will be disabled if the server denies the use of compression.\nOur Private Tunnel cloud service had compression switched off already, so is not affected by this issue.\nThe MELTDOWN and SPECTRE vulnerabilities\nFor a short while now it's been known that there are some serious flaws called Meltdown and Spectre that are causing possible security problems for almost all computers. A solution for this, or at least most of the problems, has been created in the form of kernel patches and adjustments in the deepest levels of operating systems like Windows, Macintosh, and Linux, and so on. OpenVPN Access Server itself is only a user-space program and does not run in the kernel and therefore we as creators of the Access Server product do not create these patches. However, we can inform our users on how to get the necessary patches.\nA research team from the University of New Mexico discovered a vulnerability currently being tracked as CVE-2019-14899 which claims that VPN connections can be hijacked on Linux and Unix systems.

Do Not Install standard firmware (e.g. v.4.1.xx) on this model. Doing so will permanently damage your system. You must use custom firmware v.4.1.25 from the iDS-9632NXI-I8/16S product page. As more affordable IP cameras are introduced over time with greater video resolution and data sizes, more efficient database management also becomes necessary. The introduction of firmware v4.0 brought about a new database architecture in order to be futureproof. Upgrading from v3.4.92 build 170518 or Older All recorders must reach v3.4.92 before proceeding further. Upgrading from versions before v3.4.92 directly to any version of v4.X will likely cause the recorder to fail. If the recorder is already at v3.4.92, a full factory default is highly recommended before upgrading to any version of v4.X. There is a high chance of unit failure (requiring RMA) if the unit is not defaulted before upgrade. After reaching v3.4.92 and performing a full factory default, an upgrade directly to v4.50.00 is acceptable. Upgrading from Any v4.X Build to v4.50.00. Any v4.X build can be upgraded directly to v4.50.00. If upgrading from any v4.X version that was not v4.22.005, a Database Repair is recommended. Refer to Step 4 and onwards in the previous section. View the most updated version of this document here: K-Series DVR upgrade instruction The Turbo 4 Hybrid DVR K series has multiple models and across different platform and chipset. It also has similar firmware development of other recording product line; DVR K series has also introduced the GUI4.0 to ensure the series to be compatible to the newest technology available. The new database architecture is also brought into the DVR firmware v4.0 to be future proof and for better recording search experience. As more affordable cameras introduced over time with greater video resolution and data sizes, more efficient database management also becomes necessary. The introduction of firmware v4.0 brought about a new database architecture in order to be futureproof. After upgrading to v4.X, the recorder database will need to be converted and optimize.

This codebase contains a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication and access control channel data on servers configured with deferred authentication. It is possible that this control channel data could be used to trigger further information leaks or gain access to protected networks. If the client-side scripting feature is in use, these scripts could be obtained through such an attack. If those scripts contain sensitive information, this information could be compromised. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have a valid, user-locked or auto-login client profile for the vulnerable Access Server, or credentials to obtain such a profile. Although exploiting this vulnerability requires some preparation on the attacker's side, the severity of a successful attack is high to critical, depending on the gained information.

H2 database had a critical vulnerability similar to Log4Shell which potentially allows JNDI remote codebase loading.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader. CVE-2022-41722\nA path traversal vulnerability exists in filepath.Clean on Windows.

CVE-2023-32233 vulnerability kernel 6.4-rc1 A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing batch requests to update nf_tables configuration. This vulnerability can be abused to perform arbitrary reads and writes in kernel memory. A local user (with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. Use-After-Free in Netfilter nf_tables (net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c)\ncan be abused by unprivileged local users to execute arbitrary Kernel\ncode.\n\nThe issue has been reproduced on:\n* the current kernel build `5.19.0-41-generic` (x86_64) on\n  Ubuntu 22.10, and\n* the current mainline v6.3 (commit\n  457391b0380335d5e9a5babdec90ac53928b23b4).

If cannot disable firewall, then use mitigation 2 instead (with namespaces). Thanks, do we have visibility on when fixes can be backported? \nAlso, does it affect rootless container? Hi,\nWhen I set user.max_user_namespaces = 0 on my laptop:) witch Oracle Linux Server release 9.2, upower.service crashes: (code=exited, status=217/USER). Then I don't see status of load my battery and I don't have prompts to connect my charger when power is low.

Never in Strapi's history have we had a security researcher go above and beyond to help us improve the security of our product. We are very thankful for their work and dedication, the amount of detail they placed in their PoCs was simply outstanding and allowed us to quickly verify and patch the vulnerabilities. We simply cannot thank them enough for their work and for transparency; Strapi does not have a bug bounty program (for several reasons, largely because it tends to attract very mundane and invalid security reports) but in this case we did want to reward GhostCcamm for their work and did offer them a monetary reward.\nFor additional information about each of the vulnerabilities from the security researcher's perspective, please see their extremely detailed blog post, additionally below are their social links.\nBlog post for these vulnerabilities: https://www.ghostccamm.com/blog/multi_strapi_vulns/\nWe at Strapi do believe in responsible disclosure, in the case of these vulnerabilities we have worked with the security researcher to ensure that the vulnerabilities were patched before the full disclosure of the vulnerabilities. Once a vulnerability is patched, we added a notice to our release notes to inform users there was a security vulnerability but initially wanted to delay detailed disclosure for a few weeks to give time for users to upgrade before release of the full disclosure. As an additional step we did immediately notify our customers via several emails beforehand to ensure they were aware of the vulnerabilities and to upgrade their Strapi servers.\nWe do believe that delaying the detailed disclosure in this case was important to ensure that users had the time required to upgrade their Strapi servers before making the details of each vulnerability public and thus placing that information in the hands of bad actors. We also believe that the security researcher was very professional and responsible in their handling of the vulnerabilities and we are very thankful for their work in helping us to improve the security of Strapi.\nWe urge anyone who believes they have discovered a security vulnerability to assist us in responsibly disclosing the vulnerability to us by emailing security@strapi.io.","cve_id":"CVE-2023-22621","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034490000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://strapi.io/blog/security-disclosure-of-vulnerabilities-cve","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":1541,"raw_description":"\n7.10.7\n7.50.3\nCVE-2016-8624: invalid URL parsing with '#'\n6.0\n7.50.3","cve_id":"CVE-2016-8624","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685033983000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://curl.se/docs/security.html","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":2310,"raw_description":"\nofficial-cve-feed\nIssues or PRs related to CVEs officially announced by Security Response Committee (SRC)\nCVE-2022-3162: Unauthorized read of Custom Resources\nofficial-cve-feed\nIssues or PRs related to CVEs officially announced by Security Response Committee (SRC)","cve_id":"CVE-2022-3162","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1685034218000,"last_modified_date":1684987200000,"source_url":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea%2Fsecurity+in%3Atitle+CVE&utf8=%E2%9C%93","is_garbage":-1},{"raw_description_id":995,"raw_description":"\nAn out of memory panic vulnerability exists in the crossplane-runtime libraries.

There is a question and answer document published by the OpenSSL project that provides more detailed information. With this security advisory we aim to provide information on whether your OpenVPN software is affected, and if it is, how to resolve the issue. CVE-2022-3786 CVE-2022-3602\nOpenVPN Access Server uses the OpenSSL library that comes with the operating system. On most operating systems this is OpenSSL 1.1.1, and that is not affected by this security issue. If however you run Access Server on Ubuntu 22 or Red Hat 9 (or equivalent OS) it will be using the OpenSSL 3 library and you should remediate the situation by upgrading the OpenSSL 3 library in the operating system using the standard apt or yum tools. Guidance on the commands to perform to install updates on these operating systems are in the resolution section below.\nOpenVPN Cloud uses OpenSSL 1.1.1 and is therefore not affected.\nOpenVPN Connect uses OpenSSL 1.1.1 and is therefore not affected.\nOpenVPN GUI uses OpenSSL 1.1.1 and is therefore not affected.\nOpenVPN community edition is affected by this issue if you use OpenSSL 3.\nOpenVPN for Android is affected, and updating to version 0.7.42 resolves the issue.\nOther programs that use OpenVPN may also be affected. We recommend to check with the software maintainer if it is affected and if there is an update available to resolve the issue.\nTo update packages on your operating system (including the OpenSSL 3 library) you can execute the update/upgrade commands as a user with root privileges.\nIf you see a version like 1.1.1n then you are using OpenSSL 1.1.1 and are not affected by this issue. If you see a version that starts with a 3, check that the particular OpenSSL release for your operating system resolves CVE-2022-3786 and CVE-2022-3602.\nOn the 1st of November 2022 the OpenSSL project released security updates marked with high priority for OpenSSL 3 (CVE-2022-3786\nIf you see a version like 1.1.1n then you are using OpenSSL 1.1.1 and are not affected by this issue.
