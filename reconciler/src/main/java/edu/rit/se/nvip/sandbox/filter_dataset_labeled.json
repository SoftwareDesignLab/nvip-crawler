If you have not already upgraded beyond Strapi v4.5.6 we do urge you to do so as quickly as possible (we strongly advise upgrading beyond v4.8.0 where other security vulnerabilities were patched). If you are unable to upgrade we have released several patch-package patches for this particular vulnerability.\nCVE-2023-22621 IoC’s\n/users-permissions/email-templates\nSpecifically you should look for odd code contained within the <%STUFF HERE%> blocks as this is what is used to bypass the lodash templating system. If you find any code that is not a variable name, or a variable name that is not defined in the template you are most likely impacted and should take immediate steps to confirm there are no malicious applications running on your servers.\nCVE-2023-22621 Timeline\nReport of the vulnerability received by the Strapi security team.\nConfirmation sent that we were able to successfully reproduce the vulnerability and provided an estimated 1 week timeline to patch the vulnerability due to the holiday period.\nSecurity Researcher sent request to Mitre to reserve a CVE ID for this vulnerability.\nStrapi team developed a fix for this vulnerability and released a nightly build for testing the patch.\nMitre reserved CVE ID CVE-2023-22621 for this vulnerability.

Never in Strapi's history have we had a security researcher go above and beyond to help us improve the security of our product. We are very thankful for their work and dedication, the amount of detail they placed in their PoCs was simply outstanding and allowed us to quickly verify and patch the vulnerabilities. We simply cannot thank them enough for their work and for transparency; Strapi does not have a bug bounty program (for several reasons, largely because it tends to attract very mundane and invalid security reports) but in this case we did want to reward GhostCcamm for their work and did offer them a monetary reward.\nFor additional information about each of the vulnerabilities from the security researcher's perspective, please see their extremely detailed blog post, additionally below are their social links.\nBlog post for these vulnerabilities: https://www.ghostccamm.com/blog/multi_strapi_vulns/\nWe at Strapi do believe in responsible disclosure, in the case of these vulnerabilities we have worked with the security researcher to ensure that the vulnerabilities were patched before the full disclosure of the vulnerabilities. Once a vulnerability is patched, we added a notice to our release notes to inform users there was a security vulnerability but initially wanted to delay detailed disclosure for a few weeks to give time for users to upgrade before release of the full disclosure. As an additional step we did immediately notify our customers via several emails beforehand to ensure they were aware of the vulnerabilities and to upgrade their Strapi servers.\nWe do believe that delaying the detailed disclosure in this case was important to ensure that users had the time required to upgrade their Strapi servers before making the details of each vulnerability public and thus placing that information in the hands of bad actors. We also believe that the security researcher was very professional and responsible in their handling of the vulnerabilities and we are very thankful for their work in helping us to improve the security of Strapi.\nWe urge anyone who believes they have discovered a security vulnerability to assist us in responsibly disclosing the vulnerability to us by emailing security@strapi.io.","cve_id":"CVE-2023-22621","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1684987200000,"last_modified_date":1685034490000,"source_url":"https://strapi.io/blog/security-disclosure-of-vulnerabilities-cve","is_garbage":0},{"raw_description_id":100,"raw_description":"\nPandora FMS 7.0 NG before 735 suffers from local privilege escalation due to improper permissions on C:\\PandoraFMS and its sub-folders, allowing standard users to create new files.

There is a question and answer document published by the OpenSSL project that provides more detailed information. With this security advisory we aim to provide information on whether your OpenVPN software is affected, and if it is, how to resolve the issue. CVE-2022-3786 CVE-2022-3602\nOpenVPN Access Server uses the OpenSSL library that comes with the operating system. On most operating systems this is OpenSSL 1.1.1, and that is not affected by this security issue. If however you run Access Server on Ubuntu 22 or Red Hat 9 (or equivalent OS) it will be using the OpenSSL 3 library and you should remediate the situation by upgrading the OpenSSL 3 library in the operating system using the standard apt or yum tools. Guidance on the commands to perform to install updates on these operating systems are in the resolution section below.\nOpenVPN Cloud uses OpenSSL 1.1.1 and is therefore not affected.\nOpenVPN Connect uses OpenSSL 1.1.1 and is therefore not affected.\nOpenVPN GUI uses OpenSSL 1.1.1 and is therefore not affected.\nOpenVPN community edition is affected by this issue if you use OpenSSL 3.\nOpenVPN for Android is affected, and updating to version 0.7.42 resolves the issue.\nOther programs that use OpenVPN may also be affected. We recommend to check with the software maintainer if it is affected and if there is an update available to resolve the issue.\nTo update packages on your operating system (including the OpenSSL 3 library) you can execute the update/upgrade commands as a user with root privileges.\nIf you see a version like 1.1.1n then you are using OpenSSL 1.1.1 and are not affected by this issue. If you see a version that starts with a 3, check that the particular OpenSSL release for your operating system resolves CVE-2022-3786 and CVE-2022-3602.\nOn the 1st of November 2022 the OpenSSL project released security updates marked with high priority for OpenSSL 3 (CVE-2022-3786\nIf you see a version like 1.1.1n then you are using OpenSSL 1.1.1 and are not affected by this issue.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a valid low-privileged SSH key to an affected device from a host that has an IP address that is configured as the source for a high-privileged user account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected device through SSH as a high-privileged user. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco StarOS Software and are configured for key-based SSH authentication for multiple usernames that share the same IP address: For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software section of this advisory. To determine if a device is affected by this vulnerability, look for the authorized-key command in the server sshd configuration. A device is affected by this vulnerability if there are two or more instances of the command with the same IP address configured on the host parameter, as in the following example: [local]host_name(config-sshd)# authorized-key username Administrator1 host 192.168.1.1 [local]host_name(config-sshd)# authorized-key username Operator1 host 192.168.1.1 Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. To remove the attack vector for this vulnerability, user accounts configured for SSH key-based authentication must each use a different IP address. Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels. Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html In the following table, the left column lists Cisco software releases.

The method is called traffic magnification and basically comes down to make a small request that results in a larger response to a specific target. Enough of these attacks could bring a server down (DoS). Other serious issues have also been found. You can read more about it in the pages linked to below. Fortunately for our users of the OpenVPN Access Server on AWS, our default security groups settings that come with the appliance do not provide access to the NTP daemon at all. So unless these were changed and access was granted to the NTP service port, this flaw cannot be exploited remotely with our Amazon AWS instances. CVE-2016-9310\nUbuntu has created their own page regarding this issue and they have issued fixes for the NTP package. Ordinary apt-get update and apt-get upgrade commands should update your packages to the latest versions that contain fixes for this particular issue.

CVE-2015-8618\nInt.Exp Montgomery mishandled carry propagation and produced an incorrect output, which makes it easier for attackers to obtain private RSA keys via unspecified vectors. This issue can affect RSA computations in crypto/rsa, which is used by crypto/tls. TLS servers on 32-bit systems could plausibly leak their RSA private key due to this issue. Other protocol implementations that create many RSA signatures could also be impacted in the same way. Specifically, incorrect results in one part of the RSA Chinese Remainder computation can cause the result to be incorrect in such a way that it leaks one of the primes. While RSA blinding should prevent an attacker from crafting specific inputs that trigger the bug, on 32-bit systems the bug can be expected to occur at random around one in 2^26 times. Thus collecting around 64 million signatures (of known data) from an affected server should be enough to extract the private key used. Note that on 64-bit systems, the frequency of the bug is so low (less than one in 2^50) that it would be very difficult to exploit.","cve_id":"CVE-2015-8618","created_date":1684987200000,"published_date":1684987200000,"last_modified_date":1685034406000,"source_url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/list","is_garbage":0}]
