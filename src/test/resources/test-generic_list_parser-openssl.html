<dd>The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to
implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate
verification. However the implementation of the function does not
enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect

<dd>There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but
the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type
of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by
the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an
ASN1_STRING.</dd><dd>When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass
arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to
provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a
valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other
input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which
is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect
applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs
over a network.</dd><dd> Found by David Benjamin (Google).

<dd>The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming
ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the
SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by
end user applications.</dd><dd>The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter
BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of
the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS
recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function
returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain
is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains
internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on
to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most
likely result in a crash.</dd><dd></dd><dd>This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which
may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on
the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,
SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.</dd><dd>Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include
i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and
i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.</dd><dd>The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.</dd><dd>

caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a
PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex()
will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer
to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer
then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This
could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM
files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.</dd><dd>The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around
PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.</dd><dd>These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL
functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and
SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal
uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the
header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations
include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in
OpenSSL 3.0.</dd><dd>The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.</dd><dd>

<dd>OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy 
EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This 
function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are 
instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to 
implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly 
handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), 
EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as 
other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation 
functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly 
tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An 
equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to 
EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID 
for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to 
incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to 
EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL 
encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher
 as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. 
This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third
 party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL
 cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. 
Applications are only affected by this issue if they call 
EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call 
to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that 
only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue.</dd><dd> Found by Chris Rapier (Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center).<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.6 <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5485c56679d7c49b96e8fc8ca708b0b7e7c03c4b">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 3.0.0)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite 
incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key 
trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by 
performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one
 endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would 
still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 
3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by 
the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many 
application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the 
server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server 
would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both 
endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent
 in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be 
affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the 
absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint 
communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the 
handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is 
not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that 
has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In 
order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate
 the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in
 OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the 
default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3
 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this 
ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been 
compiled with the (non-default) compile time option 
enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider 
explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration)
 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite 
list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1)
 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both
 endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any 
others that both endpoints have in common. </dd><dd> Found by Tom Colley (Broadcom).<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=7d56a74a96828985db7354a55227a511615f732b">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 3.0.0)</li></ul></dd>

contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. 
Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain 
elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve
 parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible
 to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid
 explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to 
verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an 
externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of 
service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing 
crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve 
parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming 
server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - 
Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - 
Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers -
 Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any 
other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can 
control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the 
OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial 
parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the
 infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from
 the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the 
attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during 
verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL 
versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 
1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022.</dd><dd> Found by Tavis Ormandy (Google).<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=a466912611aa6cbdf550cd10601390e587451246">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 3.0.0)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=3118eb64934499d93db3230748a452351d1d9a65">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.1.1)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd <a href="https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html?giturl=https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=380085481c64de749a6dd25cdf0bcf4360b30f83">(premium support)</a> (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring 
procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 
1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the 
pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing 
private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a 
result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not 
believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible 
(although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce 
information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of 
resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for
 an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the 
DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option 
since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1

<dd>Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client 
side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may 
return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for 
example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by 
OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or 
SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to 
SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This 
return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the 
application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). 
Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY 
return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and 
applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour 
will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite 
loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more 
serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will 
cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a
 certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include
 the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate 
Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with 
valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce 
incorrect, application dependent behaviour.</dd><dd> Found by Tobias Nießen.<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=758754966791c537ea95241438454aa86f91f256">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 3.0.0)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an 
ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data 
and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C 
strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is 
terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1
 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own "d2i" functions (and other 
similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been 
set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate 
the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for
 applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which 
do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the "data" and 
"length" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using 
the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print 
ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array 
will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings 
that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an 
ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains 
ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application 
without NUL terminating the "data" field, then a read buffer overrun can
 occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing
 of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly 
constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL 
parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated 
ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), 
X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious 
actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and 
then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this 
issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of 
Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private 
memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).</dd><dd> Found by Ingo Schwarze.<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=94d23fcff9b2a7a8368dfe52214d5c2569882c11">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.1.1)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za <a href="https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html?giturl=https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ccb0a11145ee72b042d10593a64eaf9e8a55ec12">(premium support)</a> (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to
 call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will
 call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the "out" parameter
 can be NULL and, on exit, the "outlen" parameter is populated with the 
buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application 
can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call 
EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the
 "out" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code
 means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the 
plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be 
smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead 
to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the 
application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious 
attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an 
application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by 
up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held 
after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the
 application to crash. The location of the buffer is application 
dependent but is typically heap allocated.</dd><dd> Found by John Ouyang.<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=59f5e75f3bced8fc0e130d72a3f582cf7b480b46">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.1.1)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks 
of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by 
default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow 
certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve 
parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the 
implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check 
to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was 
overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA 
certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a 
"purpose" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for
 checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named "purpose" 
values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a 
purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when 
the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl 
client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be 
overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an 
application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification
 flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, 
in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default 
purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue.

<dd>OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate 
SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more 
recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback 
attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS 
versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of 
padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject
 connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is
 present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred 
(i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is
 the version that is being requested). The implementation of this 
padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is 
accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This 
means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback
 attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a 
connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 
1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. 
In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 
support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured 
SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured 
SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) 
OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not 
vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation 
of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the 
RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. 
Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() 
function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. 
Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode 
will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the 
SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security 
issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer

<dd>The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing 
different types of names. One of those name types is known as 
EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which 
compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal 
or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs 
contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may 
occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself 
uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL 
distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution
 point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a 
timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name 
(exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and 
TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being 
compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the 
attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious 
certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some 
applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a 
certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the 
certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and 
verify tools have support for the "-crl_download" option which 
implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been 
demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug 
means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct 
correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a
 malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence 
trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected

<dd>The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which 
can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in 
connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In 
such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on
 all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack 
can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across 
multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH 
ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2

<dd>Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and 
this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some 
cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters 
(instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that 
such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even 
where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is 
used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths 
which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature 
operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the 
ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where 
explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an 
application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not 
vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used.</dd><dd> Found by Cesar Pereida García, Sohaib ul Hassan, Nicola Tuveri, Iaroslav Gridin, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Brumley.<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=30c22fa8b1d840036b8e203585738df62a03cec8">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.1.1)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=7c1709c2da5414f5b6133d00a03fc8c5bf996c7a">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.1.0)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=21c856b75d81eff61aa63b4f036bb64a85bf6d46">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find
 a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in 
TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is 
configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. For
 OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets 
assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a 
Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as
 well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs 
are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at 
sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local', which may be world writable, which 
enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, 
insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine 
modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for
 OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. 
However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 
1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix. OpenSSL versions 
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited 
scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and
 therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.</dd><dd> Found by Rich Mirch.<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=54aa9d51b09d67e90db443f682cface795f5af9e">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.1.1)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=b15a19c148384e73338aa7c5b12652138e35ed28">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.1.0)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=d333ebaf9c77332754a9d5e111e2f53e1de54fdd">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce 
input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce 
value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce
 length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 
bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 
bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any 
additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this 
cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused 
nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity 
attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer
 than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce
 expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an 
application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. 
Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the 
integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the 
integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further 
affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS,
 is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user 
applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce 
length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 
1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of 
affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and 
therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.</dd><dd> Found by Joran Dirk Greef of Ronomon.<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1c <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=f426625b6ae9a7831010750490a5f0ad689c5ba3">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.1.1)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0k <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ee22257b1418438ebaf54df98af4e24f494d1809">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.1.0)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls 
SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive 
one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a
 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte 
record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves 
differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote 
peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to 
decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched" 
ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised 
implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the 
application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has 
occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). AEAD 
ciphersuites are not impacted.</dd><dd> Found by Juraj Somorovsky,

<dd>There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication 
procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms 
are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a 
result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not 
believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, 
because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private
 key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such
 an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be 
meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among 
multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This
 only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions 
like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is
 similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. Due to the 
low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 
1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it

<dd>OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an "error 
state" mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a
 handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would 
immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works 
as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), 
SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work 
correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that 
scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in 
the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently 
called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed 
and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from 
the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application 
bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to 
SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having already received a 
fatal error.</dd><dd> Found by David Benjamin (Google).<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=898fb884b706aaeb283de4812340bb0bde8476dc">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.0.2b)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific 
Montgomery multiplication procedure that handles input lengths divisible
 by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against 
RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the 
subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key 
itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug 
can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation 
failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with
 specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 
curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. 
Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are
 considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve 
in question and the server has to share the private key among them, 
neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose
 the curve will be affected.</dd><dd> Found by Publicly reported.<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0c <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2a7dd548a6f5d6f7f84a89c98323b70a2822406e">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.1.0)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2k <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=57c4b9f6a2f800b41ce2836986fe33640f6c3f8a">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker could force up to 21Mb 
to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead to a Denial of 
Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message length
 check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to 
immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL_free() on the 
failed conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory 
will then be immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory 
allocation will be transitory in nature. This then means that there is 
only a security impact if: 1) The application does not call SSL_free() 
in a timely manner in the event that the connection fails or 2) The 
application is working in a constrained environment where there is very 
little free memory or 3) The attacker initiates multiple connection 
attempts such that there are multiple connections in a state where 
memory has been allocated for the connection; SSL_free() has not yet 
been called; and there is insufficient memory to service the multiple 
requests. Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is 
likely to be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the 
memory is subsequently freed again in the SSL_free() call. However there
 is an increased risk during this period of application crashes due to 
the lack of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of 
Service.</dd><dd> Found by Shi Lei (Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc.).<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0a <a href="https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=df6b5e29ffea2d5a3e08de92fb765fdb21c7a21e">(git commit)</a> (Affected since 1.1.0)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>A TLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the 
message. This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of
 this length are excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a

memory being consumed to service a connection. A flaw in the logic of

<dd>Because DES (and triple-DES) has only a 64-bit block size, birthday 
attacks are a real concern. For example, with the ability to run 
Javascript in a browser, it is possible to send enough traffic to cause a
 collision, and then use that information to recover something like a 
session Cookie. Triple-DES, which shows up as “DES-CBC3” in an OpenSSL 
cipher string, is still used on the Web, and major browsers are not yet 
willing to completely disable it. If you run a server, you should 
disable triple-DES. This is generally a configuration issue. If you run 
an old server that doesn’t support any better ciphers than DES or RC4, 
you should upgrade. For 1.0.2 and 1.0.1, we removed the triple-DES 
ciphers from the “HIGH” keyword and put them into “MEDIUM.” Note that we
 did not remove them from the “DEFAULT” keyword. For the 1.1.0 release, 
we treat triple-DES just like we are treating RC4. It is not compiled by
 default; you have to use “enable-weak-ssl-ciphers” as a config option. 
Even when those ciphers are compiled, triple-DES is only in the “MEDIUM”
 keyword. In addition we also removed it from the “DEFAULT” keyword.</dd><dd> Found by Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent from Inria.<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2i (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>This issue affected versions of OpenSSL prior to April 2015. The bug
 causing the vulnerability was fixed on April 18th 2015, and released as
 part of the June 11th 2015 security releases. The security impact of 
the bug was not known at the time. In previous versions of OpenSSL, 
ASN.1 encoding the value zero represented as a negative integer can 
cause a buffer underflow with an out-of-bounds write in 
i2c_ASN1_INTEGER. The ASN.1 parser does not normally create "negative 
zeroes" when parsing ASN.1 input, and therefore, an attacker cannot 
trigger this bug. However, a second, independent bug revealed that the 
ASN.1 parser (specifically, d2i_ASN1_TYPE) can misinterpret a large 
universal tag as a negative zero value. Large universal tags are not 
present in any common ASN.1 structures (such as X509) but are accepted 
as part of ANY structures. Therefore, if an application deserializes 
untrusted ASN.1 structures containing an ANY field, and later 
reserializes them, an attacker may be able to trigger an out-of-bounds 
write. This has been shown to cause memory corruption that is 
potentially exploitable with some malloc implementations. Applications 
that parse and re-encode X509 certificates are known to be vulnerable. 
Applications that verify RSA signatures on X509 certificates may also be
 vulnerable; however, only certificates with valid signatures trigger 
ASN.1 re-encoding and hence the bug. Specifically, since OpenSSL's 
default TLS X509 chain verification code verifies the certificate chain 
from root to leaf, TLS handshakes could only be targeted with valid 
certificates issued by trusted Certification Authorities.</dd><dd> Found by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat), Hanno Böck, David Benjamin (Google).<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1o (Affected since 1.0.1)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2c (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. If an 
attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a 
previous call to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length 
check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis
 of all OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function all 
usage is one of two forms. The first form is where the 
EVP_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first called function after 
an EVP_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call must be safe. The
 second form is where the length passed to EVP_EncryptUpdate() can be 
seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no 
possibility of an overflow. Since all instances are one of these two 
forms, it is believed that there can be no overflows in internal code 
due to this problem. It should be noted that EVP_DecryptUpdate() can 
call EVP_EncryptUpdate() in certain code paths. Also EVP_CipherUpdate() 
is a synonym for EVP_EncryptUpdate(). All instances of these calls have 
also been analysed too and it is believed there are no instances in 
internal usage where an overflow could occur. This could still represent
 a security issue for end user code that calls this function directly.</dd><dd> Found by Guido Vranken.<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1t (Affected since 1.0.1)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2h (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

amounts of untrusted data may be vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis

<dd>A cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption
 of TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher 
suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle. Note that traffic between
 clients and non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another 
server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different 
protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or POP) shares the RSA keys of the 
non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability is known as DROWN 
(CVE-2016-0800). Recovering one session key requires the attacker to 
perform approximately 2^50 computation, as well as thousands of 
connections to the affected server. A more efficient variant of the 
DROWN attack exists against unpatched OpenSSL servers using versions 
that predate 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf released on 19/Mar/2015 
(see CVE-2016-0703 below). Users can avoid this issue by disabling the 
SSLv2 protocol in all their SSL/TLS servers, if they've not done so 
already. Disabling all SSLv2 ciphers is also sufficient, provided the 
patches for CVE-2015-3197 (fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1r and 1.0.2f) have been
 deployed. Servers that have not disabled the SSLv2 protocol, and are 
not patched for CVE-2015-3197 are vulnerable to DROWN even if all SSLv2 
ciphers are nominally disabled, because malicious clients can force the 
use of SSLv2 with EXPORT ciphers. OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s deploy the 
following mitigation against DROWN: SSLv2 is now by default disabled at 
build-time. Builds that are not configured with "enable-ssl2" will not 
support SSLv2. Even if "enable-ssl2" is used, users who want to 
negotiate SSLv2 via the version-flexible SSLv23_method() will need to 
explicitly call either of: SSL_CTX_clear_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2); 
or SSL_clear_options(ssl, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2); as appropriate. Even if 
either of those is used, or the application explicitly uses the 
version-specific SSLv2_method() or its client or server variants, SSLv2 
ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search key recovery have been removed. 
Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2 56-bit DES are 
no longer available. In addition, weak ciphers in SSLv3 and up are now 
disabled in default builds of OpenSSL. Builds that are not configured 
with "enable-weak-ssl-ciphers" will not provide any "EXPORT" or "LOW" 
strength ciphers.</dd><dd> Found by Nimrod Aviram and Sebastian Schinzel.<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1s (Affected since 1.0.1)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2g (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a "%s" format 
string in the BIO_*printf functions could overflow while calculating the
 length of a string and cause an OOB read when printing very long 
strings. Additionally the internal |doapr_outch| function can attempt to
 write to an OOB memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in
 the event of a memory allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could
 be caused where the size of a buffer to be allocated is greater than 
INT_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing a very long "%s" format 
string. Memory leaks can also occur. The first issue may mask the second
 issue dependent on compiler behaviour. These problems could enable 
attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to the 
BIO_*printf functions. If applications use these functions in this way 
then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when 
printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications 
that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted 
sources. OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable 
where they print out ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as 
command line arguments. Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. 
Additionally certificates etc received via remote connections via libssl
 are also unlikely to be able to trigger these issues because of message
 size limits enforced within libssl.</dd><dd> Found by Guido Vranken.<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1s (Affected since 1.0.1)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2g (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>The SRP user database lookup method SRP_VBASE_get_by_user had 
confusing memory management semantics; the returned pointer was 
sometimes newly allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The 
calling code has no way of distinguishing these two cases. Specifically,
 SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid login 
information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker connecting with
 an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around 300 bytes per 
connection. Servers that do not configure SRP, or configure SRP but do 
not configure a seed are not vulnerable. In Apache, the seed directive 
is known as SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed. To mitigate the memory leak, the seed
 handling in SRP_VBASE_get_by_user is now disabled even if the user has 
configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate to 
SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user. However, note that OpenSSL makes no strong 
guarantees about the indistinguishability of valid and invalid logins. 
In particular, computations are currently not carried out in constant 
time.</dd><dd> Found by Emilia Käsper (OpenSSL).<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1s (Affected since 1.0.1)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2g (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>In the BN_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated 
using an int value |i|. Later |bn_expand| is called with a value of |i *
 4|. For large values of |i| this can result in |bn_expand| not 
allocating any memory because |i * 4| is negative. This can leave the 
internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a subsequent NULL ptr 
deref. For very large values of |i|, the calculation |i * 4| could be a 
positive value smaller than |i|. In this case memory is allocated to the
 internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized leading to 
heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN_dec2bn. This could have 
security consequences if BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn is ever called by user 
applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated
 to be a rare occurrence. All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions 
use data that is not expected to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or 
application command line arguments. If user developed applications 
generate config file data based on untrusted data then it is possible 
that this could also lead to security consequences. This is also

<dd>Historically OpenSSL usually only ever generated DH parameters based
 on "safe" primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided
 for generating X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for 
RFC 5114 support. The primes used in such files may not be "safe". Where
 an application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes 
that are not "safe" then an attacker could use this fact to find a 
peer's private DH exponent. This attack requires that the attacker 
complete multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same private DH 
exponent. For example this could be used to discover a TLS server's 
private DH exponent if it's reusing the private DH exponent or it's 
using a static DH ciphersuite. OpenSSL provides the option 
SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE for ephemeral DH (DHE) in TLS. It is not on by 
default. If the option is not set then the server reuses the same 
private DH exponent for the life of the server process and would be 
vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular applications
 do set this option and would therefore not be at risk. OpenSSL before 
1.0.2f will reuse the key if: - SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh()/SSL_set_tmp_dh() is
 used and SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is not set. - 
SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback()/SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback() is used, and 
both the parameters and the key are set and SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is not 
used. This is an undocumted feature and parameter files don't contain 
the key. - Static DH ciphersuites are used. The key is part of the 
certificate and so it will always reuse it. This is only supported in 
1.0.2. It will not reuse the key for DHE ciphers suites if: - 
SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is set - 
SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback()/SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback() is used and the 
callback does not provide the key, only the parameters. The callback is 
almost always used like this. Non-safe primes are generated by OpenSSL 
when using: - genpkey with the dh_rfc5114 option. This will write an 
X9.42 style file including the prime-order subgroup size "q". This is 
supported since the 1.0.2 version. Older versions can't read files 
generated in this way. - dhparam with the -dsaparam option. This has 
always been documented as requiring the single use. The fix for this 
issue adds an additional check where a "q" parameter is available (as is
 the case in X9.42 based parameters). This detects the only known 
attack, and is the only possible defense for static DH ciphersuites. 
This could have some performance impact. Additionally the 
SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE option has been switched on by default and cannot 
be disabled. This could have some performance impact.</dd><dd> Found by Antonio Sanso (Adobe).<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2f (Affected since 1.0.2)</li></ul></dd>

<dd>Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some 
platforms, including x86_64. This bug occurs at random with a very low 
probability, and is not known to be exploitable in any way, though its 
exact impact is difficult to determine. The following has been 
determined: *) The probability of BN_sqr producing an incorrect result 
at random is very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform 
(MIPS) and 1/2^128 on affected 64-bit platforms. *) On most platforms, 
RSA follows a different code path and RSA operations are not affected at
 all. For the remaining platforms (e.g. OpenSSL built without assembly 
support), pre-existing countermeasures thwart bug attacks [1]. *) Static
 ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct elliptic 
curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given curve. 
However, there is no known computationally feasible way to construct 
such points with low order, and so the security of static ECDH private 
keys is believed to be unaffected. *) Other routines known to be 
theoretically affected are modular exponentiation, primality testing, 
DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and SRP. No exploits are known and 
straightforward bug attacks fail - either the attacker cannot control 
when the bug triggers, or no private key material is involved.</dd><dd> Found by Pieter Wuille (Blockstream).<ul><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1k (Affected since 1.0.1)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.0p (Affected since 1.0.0)</li><li>Fixed in OpenSSL 0.9.8zd (Affected since 0.9.8)</li></ul></dd>
